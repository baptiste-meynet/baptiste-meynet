# Hi, I'm Baptiste!

👨‍🎓 Graduate of the Engineering School SeaTech (Aug. 2022)<br>
🌱 Currently learning about data analytics and data visualization<br>

After graduating, I decided to step outside the traditional engineering track and broaden my skill set. I gravitated toward marketing because it offered the perfect opportunity to enhance the communication skills I was eager to develop. I landed a job as a media planner, where I crafted marketing strategies, coordinated team efforts, and engaged directly with clients—a strategic move to build the interpersonal skills essential for my growth.

Looking at marketing through an engineering lens, I quickly spotted two major challenges. First, there was a growing demand for data-driven decisions to shape effective strategies. Second, many routine tasks were still done manually, even when automation could streamline them. These observations sparked my passion for data analytics, visualization, and AI-powered automation. I’m excited to leverage my technical background to dive into data and automation, uncover valuable insights, and drive overall performance in this fast-growing industry.
