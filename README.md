# Hi, I'm Baptiste!

👨‍🎓 Graduate of the Engineering School SeaTech (Aug. 2022)<br>
🌱 Currently learning about data analytics and data visualization<br>

After I graduated, I was curious about exploring industries outside of engineering to broaden my skill set. Marketing, with its creative nature, caught my interest as something different. As I got involved, I quickly understood the challenges the industry faces, especially the growing need for data-driven decisions. That’s when I decided to start my journey in data analytics and data visualization.
