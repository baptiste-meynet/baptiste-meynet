# Hi, I'm Baptiste!

## My Journey: From Engineering to Data-Driven Marketing & Automation

### 🎓 A Different Path  
After earning my engineering degree, I chose to step outside the traditional career path. I wanted to explore different industries, take on new challenges, and develop a broader way of thinking.  

### 📈 Stepping into Marketing  
Marketing caught my interest because it allowed me to:  
- Improve my communication skills
- Work in a creative environment
- Gain project management experience
- Develop hands-on experience working with clients

### 💼 Becoming a Media Planner  
I quickly landed a role as a media planner, where I:  
- Created and executed marketing strategies  
- Coordinated cross-functional teams  
- Built and maintained strong client relationships

### 🔍 The Challenges I Noticed in Marketing  
In this role, I identified two major challenges:  
- **Making Data-Driven Decisions:** Solid data insights are key to maximizing the ROI of marketing strategies and accurately measuring campaign success.  
- **The Need for Automation:** Many tasks were done manually, which slowed things down and increased the risk of errors.  

### 💡 Finding My Passion for Data & Automation  
Seeing these issues made me interested in data analytics, data visualization, and AI-powered automation. I realized that these tools could make marketing more effective and improve how media agencies work.  

### 🚀 My Next Step  
Now, I’m working on mastering data analytics and automation, building on my technical background. In the near future, my goal is to step into a role where I can help businesses make data-driven decisions and grow through automation.
